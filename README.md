# space-x-test

View a history of SpaceX missions and their payloads

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- React
- Typescript
- SASS
- Axios
- SpaceX API
- react-toastify
- react-responsive-modal

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../space-x-test

## Notes

- Given more time I'd add a mobile menu to make the navigation more scalable in mobile view
- Ideally I'd also add Jest and pre-commit hooks using Husky
